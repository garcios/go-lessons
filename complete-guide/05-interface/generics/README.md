# Generics
Generics, in the context of programming languages, are a kind of code abstraction, allowing the creation of code which 
is not specific to a particular data type. The generic components can be used with many different data types without the
need to rewrite code. This results in code that is more flexible, reusable, and easier to understand.

In Go 1.18, support for generics was added. This allows the creation of functions and data types that are parameterized 
by the types of data they use. Go's approach to Generics uses type parameters, which are special kinds of parameters 
that can take types rather than values.
